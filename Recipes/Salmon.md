# Salmon Recipes

## Zesty Salmon

### Basics

**Time:** 4 hours cooking; active time 20 minutes

**Temp:** 54 degrees C

### Ingredients

#### Brine
* 1 Tbsp ginger, crushed
* 1c salt
* 1c raw sugar
* ice cubes

#### Salmon
* 2x 200g salmon fillets
* 1 lime
* 1 lemon
* Olive Oil
* Pepper

### Method

* Dissolve the salt and raw sugar in 3 cups of boiling water
* Once dissolved, add ice cubes until the water is very chilled
* Mix the crushed ginger through the water
* Add the salmon to the brine; you can use a cheese grater to keep it submerged while still allowing the brine to touch all parts of the fish.
* Allow to brine for 1-2 hours
* Remember to get your sous vide up to temperature!

...

* After an hour or so, remove the salmon from the brine and allow to drip dry
* Drizzle with a little olive oil - no more than a tablespoon in total
* Lay it flat on the bench, skin down, and liberally grind plenty of pepper over both fillets
* Grate the zest from the lemon and the lime, and sprinkle it evenly over the fillets
* Slip the fish into your sous vide bag, and vaccuum seal the bag
* Submerge in the sous vide for 2 hours, making sure the whole bag is submerged at all times

...

* Heat a cast iron skillet over a very hot flame with a tablespoon of olive oil
* While your skillet is heating up, remove the bag from the water
* CAREFULLY lay the salmon skin-down in the skillet.  Be gentle, it will be VERY fragile.
* Sear the fish for 1-2 minutes to get a crispy skin
* Serve immediately
